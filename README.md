# Pandemic
The world is going through tough times right now. Everyone is under quarantine and the health of our loved ones matter the most at this point. I have developed a native android application inorder to record the 2 major symptoms of Covid-19 i.e Body Temperature and Oxygen Level. You can add multiple members to this app and feed data about these two symptoms and view a graphical representation. Also this app can be used to check the global cases dynamically. Thank you to https://api.covid19api.com for the API.
